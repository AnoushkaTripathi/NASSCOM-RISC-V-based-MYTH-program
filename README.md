Welcome to this hands-on journey into digital logic design! We're diving into TL-Verilog, an innovative design language pioneered by Redwood EDA. We will use the Makerchip online IDE to design, simulate, and visualize circuits. Letâ€™s start from the basics and quickly ramp up to more advanced concepts.
