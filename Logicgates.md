# Introduction to Logic gates

Logic gate is the basic building block of any digital circuits. The logic gates may have one
or more inputs and only one output. The relationship between input and output is based on a
certain logic, which is same as Boolean operations, such as AND, OR and NOT.
Based on the Boolean operations, the gates are named as AND gate, OR gate and NOT
gate. These three gates are called basic gates, and some more gates can be derived by using the
basic gates, they are named as NAND gate, NOR gate, EXOR gate and XNOR gate. NAND and
NOR gates are called universal gates, because by using only the NAND gates /NOR gates we can
realize all basic gates even all Boolean expression.
