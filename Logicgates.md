# Introduction to Logic gates

🚀 Digital Logic Fundamentals

Digital logic boils down to ones and zeros — the simplest form of information. Let’s explore how we manipulate these bits using logic gates.

### 🔧 Logic Gates

These are the core building blocks of all digital circuits. Each gate performs a basic logic function.

### 🔨 Combinational Logic

*Combinational logic circuits* produce outputs based solely on the current inputs. No memory or state is involved.

Example: Full Adder

Let’s build a simple 3-input full adder that computes:

Inputs: A, B, Cin (carry-in)

Outputs: S (sum), Cout (carry-out)

### ⏳ Sequential Logic

Unlike combinational logic, sequential circuits rely on clocks. This introduces state and allows data to flow through time.

Registers store values on clock edges

Flip-flops remember single bits
